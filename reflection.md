In this PA I was supposed to practice with files, for loops, creating functions, testing code, error checking, and utilizing the many other aspects of Python we've learned so far.

Using what the class has learned from previous lectures, I followed the design process/steps in first understanding the readme in its full, developing an algorithm, peer reviewing those, test cases, and then developing our code. Key concepts explored were writing functions, lists, files, loops, Booleans, as well as error checking.

My results did match what I expected. Because I designed my program through my algorithm, it was easier to do my code and get the results I expected. I also developed multiple test cases, which helped me make sure my code worked well.

This was the hardest assignment I've done in this class yet, so that was challenging as well as balancing this assignment, lab, and studying for the upcoming exam. I think my key takeaways from this lab was using files and accessing them and editing them, creating functions, incorporating lists and error checking, and how they can help take your code to the next level and help out a lot. I do believe I ended up learning what I was supposed to from this lab. It was hard working by myself and figuring things out on my own, and took a lot more time, but hopefully it all worked out in the end.
